                <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle.In prehistoric times, humans hunted aurochs and later
                    domesticated them. Since then, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality
                    or quantity of their meat. Today, beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, after
                    pork and poultry. As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China were the largest producers of
                    beef. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef' target='blank' title='MORE INFO'>MORE INFO</a>

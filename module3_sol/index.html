                <p id="chicken" class="item-name">Chicken</p>
                <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally
                    from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may be
                    called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen
                    and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

                    Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until
                    the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source
                    of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

                    Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7
                    billion as of 2018,[3] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[4] There are more chickens in the world
                    than any other bird.[4] There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and
                    religion, and in language and literature.

                    Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
                    Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the
                    Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to
                    Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with
                    the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
                    according to the annals of Thutmose III.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>

                <p id="beef" class="item-name">Beef</p>
                <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle.

                    In prehistoric times, humans hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since then, numerous breeds
                    of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Today, beef is the
                    third most widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry. As of 2018, the United States,
                    Brazil, and China were the largest producers of beef. In the United States, beef production has come
                    to rely heavily on factory farms. The prevalence of manure in these farms has been linked to
                    contamination of beef with E. coli, leading to large recalls, as well as increased antibiotic usage.
                    The now-restricted use of meat and bone meal feed was historically responsible for outbreaks of
                    bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow disease").

                    Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak, which can be cooked to varying
                    degrees of doneness, while trimmings are often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef
                    contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other kinds of red meat, high consumption is
                    associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease, especially when
                    processed. Beef has a high environmental impact, with the highest per gram greenhouse gas emissions
                    of any agricultural product. Requiring high land use, it is the primary driver of deforestation in
                    the Amazon rainforest, with approximately 80% of deforested land used for beef production.<a

                <p id="shushi" class="item-name">Sushi</p>
                <p>A dish known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months
                    at a time, has been cited as one of the early influences for the Japanese practice of applying rice
                    on raw fish.[3] The fish was fermented with rice vinegar, salt, and rice, after which the rice was
                    discarded. The process can be traced back to the early domestication of rice in the neolithic
                    cultures of China, fermentation methods following similar logic in other asian rice cultures
                    include: Pla ra (ปลาร้า), Burong isda, Sikhae (식해), Amazake (甘酒) .[3][4] The lacto-fermentation of
                    the rice prevents the fish from spoiling. When wet-field rice cultivation was introduced during the
                    Yayoi period, lakes and rivers would flood during the rainy season and fish would get caught in the
                    rice paddy fields. Pickling was a way to preserve the excess fish and guarantee food for the next
                    months, and Narezushi became an important source of protein for Japanese consumers. The term sushi
                    literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 酸し
                    sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb 酸い sui "to be sour";[5] the overall
                    dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.[6] Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty,
                    notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.[7]


                    Osaka-style sushi, also called "Oshi-zushi" or "hako-sushi"
                    Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for
                    the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the
                    rice, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to
                    be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka,
                    where over several centuries it became oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood
                    and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.

                    It was not until the Edo period (1603–1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice and nori.
                    The particular style of today's nigirizushi became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s
                    or 1830s. One common story of nigirizushi's origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858), who
                    invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku.[7] The dish was originally
                    termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term
                    Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its
                    ingredients' origins.[8][9]

                    The earliest written mention of sushi in English described in the Oxford English Dictionary is in an
                    1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed,
                    or some other flavoring".[10][11] There is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn's
                    Japanese-English dictionary from 1873,[12] and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal
